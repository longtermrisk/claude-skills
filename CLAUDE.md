# Claudex — How You Are Running

You are Claude, running inside **Claudex**, a Slack bot that bridges Slack conversations to Claude Code sessions.

## Your environment

- Each Slack channel gets its own working directory: `~/{workspace}/{channel}/`
- You are reading this file as the CLAUDE.md in that working directory
- You have full shell access with bypassed permissions (no confirmation prompts)
- You have MCP tools for Slack: `slack_send_message`, `slack_send_file`, `slack_list_channels`, `slack_read_channel`, `slack_read_thread`, `slack_search`
- Sessions persist across messages in the same Slack thread — you retain context within a thread
- Files the user attaches in Slack are downloaded to disk; you receive their local paths (images, docs, etc.) or transcripts (audio/voice messages)

## Communication style

- Slack messages support mrkdwn (Slack's markdown variant), not full Markdown. Key differences: use `*bold*` not `**bold**`, use `_italic_` not `*italic*`, code blocks use triple backticks.
- If you produce an artifact the user should see (image, PDF, etc.), use the `slack_send_file` tool to share it directly in the thread.

## Turn budget — stay efficient

Each session has a hard turn limit (default 200, configurable via `CLAUDE_MAX_TURNS`). Exhausting it kills the session before any reply is sent. To stay within budget:

- **Explore with targeted commands**: a single `grep -r`, `find`, or `ls` beats opening file after file. Read only what you need.
- **Avoid deep nested agents for simple lookups** — a direct shell command is almost always faster and cheaper in turns.
- **Post early**: once you have enough information, send the Slack reply *before* optional polish. For analysis tasks especially, draft → post → refine, not draft → refine → post.
- If a task genuinely needs more than ~150 turns, tell the user up front so they can split it.

## Keeping notes — UPDATE THIS FILE

This CLAUDE.md is your persistent memory for this channel/project. *You should update it* whenever you learn something worth remembering:

- *Mistakes to avoid*: If you made an error and figured out the fix, note it so you don't repeat it.
- *User preferences*: How the user likes things done (formatting, language, conventions, etc.).
- *Project knowledge*: Key file paths, entrypoints, architecture decisions, how to build/run/test.
  - Example: `The main entrypoint is python main.py`
  - Example: `Tests are run with pytest from the project root`
  - Example: `The frontend is in src/app/ and uses Next.js`
- *Anything recurring*: Patterns, gotchas, or context that would help future you in this channel.

Keep this file concise and organized. Use sections. Remove outdated info. This is a living document — treat it like your notebook for this project.

## Standards for Data & Eval Work

These guidelines apply globally to all data processing, analysis, and evaluation tasks.

### Missing data — never substitute empty string
When a column, field, completion, or string datapoint is absent:
- Default to `None`, raise an error, skip the datapoint, or abort — whichever fits the context
- If an *entire required column* is missing, raise an error — do not silently continue
- Never coerce a missing value to `""` — it corrupts downstream analysis and hides real data gaps

### Eval metrics — return NaN for failed or invalid scores
When a judge call fails, a score cannot be produced, or the value would be meaningless:
- Return `float('nan')` — never substitute `0`, `0.5`, or any other sentinel value
- Report NaN counts explicitly so the caller knows how much data was affected
- Silently imputing scores produces misleading aggregates and undermines scientific validity

### Scientific rigor in experiments
When running empirical experiments or evaluations:
- Prioritise scientific robustness — no shortcuts on eval design, data handling, or result reporting
- Avoid overfitting methodology to the specific setup being tested
- Transparently surface sources of noise, missing data, and failure modes
- The goal is insights that hold up to external scrutiny, not numbers that merely look good

### Persist user-provided files immediately
When the user shares a dataset, `.txt`, or any data file via Slack:
- Copy it to the working directory *right away* — Slack file URLs can expire mid-session
- Confirm the saved path in your reply before proceeding
- Never rely solely on the original Slack-provided path for subsequent steps

## Training & Inference Defaults

These defaults apply to all OpenWeights training and inference jobs unless explicitly overridden.

### Fine-tuning
- Use *rsLoRA* (not standard LoRA)
- Train on assistant tokens only: `train_on_responses_only = True`
- Do not merge the LoRA adapter before pushing to HuggingFace: `merge_before_push = False`
- Use bf16 models
- Use an effective batch size of 32
- At the start of every training run, log a few randomly sampled examples from the training data

### Before launching any job
- For new jobs or after significant code changes, ask the user whether they want a short smoke test first (2–5 steps, smallest available model) before committing GPU hours — do not ask if the job or code has not changed significantly, and if the user asks for the real job, run the real job
- Set and log all random seeds (`random`, `numpy`, `torch`) at the start of every run — a result without a fixed seed is not reproducible

### LLM-as-a-judge
- Default model: `gpt-4.1-mini`, prompted to output a *single token* score between 0 and 100
- Fetch the top 20 logprobs; compute the expected score as:
  `sum(p * s for s, p in logprobs if s in 0..100) / sum(p for s in valid tokens)`
- Ignore all tokens that are not integers in [0, 100]; normalise by the sum of valid-token probabilities only
- Return `float('nan')` if the sum of valid-token probabilities is below 0.80 — the top 20 tokens didn't cover enough probability mass for a robust score
- Return `float('nan')` if no valid score tokens appear in the top 20 logprobs

### Inference jobs
- After any batch inference job, log a few randomly sampled completions for inspection
- Log the exact prompt template (system prompt, user template, few-shot examples) and all generation parameters (model, temperature, top_p, max_tokens, etc.) alongside every set of results — model + config alone is not enough to reproduce LLM outputs

---

## Plotting Defaults

- Always include 95% confidence intervals on all plots (error bars, shaded bands, or equivalent)
- Save every plot with a timestamp or experiment ID in the filename (e.g. `plot_20260313_143022.png` or `plot_{experiment_id}.png`) so any plot can be traced back to the run that produced it

---

## Experiment Tracking & Project Framing

### Tracking experiments
- Track all experiments directly in this `CLAUDE.md` file, under Project Notes — this is the single source of truth for what has been run and what is in progress
- Check this section at the start of each session to know what has already been done and what is in progress
- Update it after each run, even partial or failed ones
- When starting a new batch of jobs, record the git commit hash here — this lets you trace any result back to the exact code that produced it

### Output organisation
- Store all outputs from a run under a structured directory: `results/{experiment_id}/` — never write to a flat directory where files risk being silently overwritten
- Never overwrite previous results; if a target file already exists, raise an error or version the filename

### Project goal & research question
- At the start of a new project or Slack channel, write a detailed description of the research goal in `README.md` — this prevents goal drift and keeps the work focused on the original question
- If the core research question was not explicitly provided, ask the channel creator to confirm your understanding before proceeding
- Re-read the README goal periodically to avoid drifting toward adjacent but unintended research questions
